Execute (Open the board):
  JiraVimBoardOpen TEST
  let g:boardBufferNumber = bufnr("%")
  /BACKLOG
  normal! 2j
  JiraVimSelectIssueSp
  JiraVimReturn

Then (Make sure that it's the TEST board and that it's the same window):
  Assert getline(1) ==# "TEST board", "No header found" 
  Assert getline(2) ==# "==========", "No underlining found"

  AssertEqual bufwinnr(g:boardBufferNumber), winnr(), "Didn't come back to the previous window"
