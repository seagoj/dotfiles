# HyperTerm Themed Scrollbar
Enhances the style of your [HyperTerm](http://hyperterm.org) scrollbar to match the style of your theme (using `config.foregroundColor`).

## Install
1. In HyperTerm, tap `⌘,` to open `~/.hyperterm.js` in your `$EDITOR`
2. Add `hyperterm-themed-scrollbar` to the `config.plugins` array. For example, here's what my `plugins` array looks like:
    ```
    plugins: [
      "hyperterm-1password",
      "hypercwd",
      "hyperseti",
      "hyperterm-themed-scrollbar"
    ],
    ```

3. Save & Exit your `$EDITOR`
4. Wait for auto reload or tap `⇧⌘R` to reload your terminal manually

A scrollbar as dystopian as the feeling you get using the [HYPERTERMINATOR theme]().

Subtle and calm like the Wyoming wilderness (when it isn't on fire) with the [Firewatch HyperTerm theme](https://github.com/leeds-ebooks/hyperterm-firewatch).

In the dark of night, a roundrect star shoots across your terminal with the [Seti for HyperTerm theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperseti).
