#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ e
#   # => opens the current directory in $EDITOR
#
#   $ e .
#   $ e /opt
#   # => opens the specified directory in $EDITOR
#
#   $ e file.txt [exists in cwd]
#   # => opens file in default editor
#
#   $ e file.txt [does not exist in cwd]
#   # => searches for previously opened files with that name through fasd
#
#   @todo - waiting for update to fasd exit code
#   $ e file.txt [does not exist in cwd; can't be found with fasd]
#   # => opens new file at passed location
