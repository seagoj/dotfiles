# Settings

You can set up a different vagrant path if your Vagrat binary is not installed in the default location, or you're using Sublime-Vagrant on a windows machine.

```{
    "vagrant_path": "/usr/bin/vagrant",
    "additional_args": ['-h', '-v']
}```

though there are very few additional arguments you can pass to Vagrant so by default there are none in the setting file.
